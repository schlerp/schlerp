He/Him

I'm a developer from sunny little Darwin in Australia. I currently work for a healthcare company building integrations for our internal EMR system across many countries around the globe. Python is my favourite programming language, and it's where I feel the most at home. Type hinting is fantastic, and I am a big fan of [Mypy](https://mypy-lang.org/) and [Pydantic](https://docs.pydantic.dev/). When I'm not flexing my fingers on the keyboard I'm usually brewing or judging beer, playing volleyball or riding my bike.

## Current Projects

I'm currently working on a couple of different personal projects. You can check them out below. Please get involved if you like; I'm always looking for help 😃. I love open-source software, and I'm keen to get more people involved with some of the things I'm working on at the moment.

### Pypes

[Pypes](https://github.com/schlerp/pypes) is a job/pipeline scheduler for High-Performance Computing. It's a bit like snakemake, but the plan is to simplify it. If you are into that type of thing, don't hesitate to hit me up about it. I'm not using the HPC I have access to as much as I used to, but I would be keen to get the ball rolling again if there was interest 🙂.

### Julienne

[Julienne](https://github.com/schlerp/julienne) is an integration engine/data pipeline. The basic idea is that a source (API endpoint/DB/CSV file etc.) ingests data and then pipes that data into a transform pipeline. The transform pipeline consists of some python code run on celery workers that do filtering/transformation/enrichment before sending onto a "sink". The places that data can be pushed to are called sinks, which could be files, databases, HTTP APIs, MLLP servers, etc.

### PELT Studio

[PELT Studio](https://github.com/schlerp/pelt-studio), it stands for Python Extract Load Transform Studio. It's what it sounds like 🤷. It has a python backend with a svelte front end. You can design SQL ELT flows with a graph/network/DAG style interface, and it will (one day) orchestrate them. Currently, it only produces queries you run manually, but there's some good potential if I can find others to build it with me 😀.
