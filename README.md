He/Him

I’m a developer hailing from sunny Darwin, Australia. Currently, I’m part of the fraud and credit reporting team at Kraken Tech (Octopus Energy), where we’re building the core global fraud framework. Previously, I worked for a healthcare company, developing integrations for their internal EMR system across various countries. Python is my favorite programming language; it’s where I truly feel at home. I particularly appreciate type hinting in Python and am a big fan of Mypy and Pydantic. When I’m not typing away at my keyboard, you can find me brewing or judging beer, playing volleyball, or riding my bike.

## Current Projects

I'm currently working on a few personal projects that I'm excited to share with you below. I welcome any involvement—I'm always looking for help! 😃 I have a passion for open-source software and am eager to engage more people in the initiatives I’m pursuing right now.

### Pypes

[Pypes](https://github.com/schlerp/pypes) is a job/pipeline scheduler for High-Performance Computing. It's a bit like snakemake, but the plan is to simplify it. If you are into that type of thing, don't hesitate to hit me up about it. I'm not using the HPC I have access to as much as I used to, but I would be keen to get the ball rolling again if there was interest 🙂.

### Julienne

[Julienne](https://github.com/schlerp/julienne) is an integration engine/data pipeline. The basic idea is that a source (API endpoint/DB/CSV file etc.) ingests data and then pipes that data into a transform pipeline. The transform pipeline consists of some python code run on celery workers that do filtering/transformation/enrichment before sending onto a "sink". The places that data can be pushed to are called sinks, which could be files, databases, HTTP APIs, MLLP servers, etc.

### PELT Studio

[PELT Studio](https://github.com/schlerp/pelt-studio), it stands for Python Extract Load Transform Studio. It's what it sounds like 🤷. It has a python backend with a svelte front end. You can design SQL ELT flows with a graph/network/DAG style interface, and it will (one day) orchestrate them. Currently, it only produces queries you run manually, but there's some good potential if I can find others to build it with me 😀.
